  # *My goal*
  I wanna become to good programmist.
 I don’t want to leave work with the _thought_ "Fuh, another day of my life has passed spent on an unloved business."
When I started to study programming, the main idea was - there are big salaries in this profession, you need to master this profession.
But in the learning process, I realized that I like to learn Js, Html, CSS - it’s really interesting, you don’t force yourself, you just come in and make a website / study the framework or do codewars.
I understand that you won’t become a programmer on the fingertips and that’s why I’m ready to go through all the tests to become a Js developer
Ps. **I have burning gas)**
You can verify this in a personal meeting at an interview)

3. Summary (your goal, wishes, reveal what is important for you, what do you want and why.
Some kind of self-presentation. In case of lack of experience  Junior Developer sells his/her potential, his/her passion and ability to learn fast. You shouldn't think that everybody is going to teach you when you come to the workplace . Rather being a Junior means always
learning new things from everywhere etc.).

    let count = 0;
    let line = 0;
    let out = '';
    let indexout = document.querySelector('.out');

    function writeneo() {
        // рисуем строку 
        let interval = setTimeout(function () {
            out += t[line][count];
            indexout.innerHTML = out + "/";
            count++;
            //проверка 
            // не закончилась ли строка 
            if (count >= t[line].length) {
                out += `<br>`;
                count = 0;
                line++;
                console.log(1);
                if (line == t.length) {
                    clearInterval(interval); // останавливваем таймаут

                    indexout.innerHTML = out; // убираем вертикальную черту 
                    return true;
                }
            }
            writeneo();
        }, getRendomInt(getRendomInt(300 * 2)));
    }
    writeneo();
}

function getRendomInt(max) {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * Math.floor(max))
}
writeneo()
